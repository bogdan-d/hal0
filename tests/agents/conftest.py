"""Shared fixtures for the hermes-provision test suite.

After the D hardened-perms env seam (hal0-agentenv), the provisioner's env
writers (``_write_secrets_env`` / ``_write_driver_env``) branch on
``os.geteuid()``: root writes the root:root files directly, an unprivileged
process delegates to ``sudo -n hal0-agentenv``. CI runs pytest as a NON-root
user, so without this fixture every pre-existing test that reaches those writers
would fall into the seam branch and shell out to sudo.

Default the whole suite to euid == 0 — the unchanged, historical direct-write
path these tests were written against. The dedicated seam tests in
``test_hermes_env_seam.py`` (and the gateway/ownership tests that already set
euid explicitly) override per-test, which takes precedence over this autouse
default for the duration of that test.
