"""normalize_argv — the single dedup/last-wins pass for llama-server argv.

The launch argv for a slot is assembled from several sources that historically
just concatenate (``container._llama_launch_plan``): the structural prefix
(``--host``/``--port``/``--model``/``--alias``/``--ctx-size``), the profile's
bench-tuned ``flags``, a resolved ``--chat-template-file``, and the slot's
``[server].extra_args``. Nothing dedups *across* those segments, so a flag the
profile sets and the slot also overrides (``-b``, ``-ctk``, ``-ngl``,
``--jinja`` …) is emitted twice. llama-server silently takes the **last**
occurrence, so the command still runs — but the rendered argv is a confusing,
unauditable soup of conflicting duplicates (the live ``agent`` slot ships
``-b`` x2, ``-ngl 999`` then ``-ngl 99``, ``--jinja`` x2).

This module collapses that to one source of truth at the argv layer:

  * **Dedup by canonical key, keep the LAST occurrence.** Because llama-server
    already used the last value, keeping it is *effective-value-preserving* —
    the slot launches identically, the argv is just clean. This is the property
    the golden-parity tests pin.
  * **Canonicalize for the key only; emit the original spelling.** ``-b`` and
    ``--batch-size`` share a key (so they dedup against each other), but the
    surviving token keeps whatever spelling the winning source used — we never
    rewrite ``-b`` into ``--batch-size`` behind the operator's back.
  * **Append-list flags are never deduped** (``--lora``/``--draft-model``/
    ``--override-kv``): llama-server treats repeats additively.
  * **Order is preserved** (each surviving flag stays at its last position),
    so the structural prefix stays first and the diff vs today is exactly "the
    earlier duplicates removed".

It is a pure function over a token list, so every assembly path
(``_llama_launch_plan``, the resolved-command preview) can route through it
without restructuring how they build the list.
