"""hal0.slots — Inference slot lifecycle management.

Owns the full lifecycle of hal0-slot@<name>.service instances:
spawn, terminate, load, unload, restart, and swap.  Exposes a state
machine (SlotState) whose transitions are atomic, persisted to
/var/lib/hal0/slots/<name>/state.json, and streamable via SSE.

Port target: haloai lib/slots.py (1082 lines), refactored for the Tier 3
state machine.  See PLAN.md §3 and §5 Tier 3.

Key exports:
    SlotManager  — primary entry point for all slot operations.
    SlotState    — enum of lifecycle states (offline, ready, serving, …).
    Slot         — runtime snapshot handle returned by SlotManager methods.
