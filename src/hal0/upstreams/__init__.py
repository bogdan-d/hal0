"""hal0.upstreams — External and local routing targets.

An Upstream is one HTTP endpoint the Dispatcher can route requests to.
Two kinds:
  - "slot"   — a local hal0 inference slot (managed by SlotManager)
  - "remote" — an external provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, custom)

UpstreamRegistry loads from /etc/hal0/upstreams.toml at startup and
supports dynamic registration for auto-discovered slots.

integrations.py holds the built-in provider catalog (_CATALOG) with
known base URLs, auth styles, and model lists.

Port targets: haloai lib/upstreams.py (737 lines), lib/integrations.py.
Adds: adaptive cold-boot timeout (PLAN.md §5 Tier 1).
See PLAN.md §3 and §5 Tier 1.

Key exports:
    Upstream         — frozen dataclass representing one routing target.
    UpstreamRegistry — runtime registry of all upstreams.
