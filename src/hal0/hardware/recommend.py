"""Hardware-driven recommendation for the default ``slots/primary.toml``.

Given a populated :class:`hal0.config.schema.HardwareInfo`, ``recommend_primary_slot``
returns a dict shaped like a :class:`hal0.config.schema.SlotConfig`. The
installer drops it at ``${ETC_DIR}/slots/primary.toml`` on first install
so a freshly-installed host has a sensible default slot waiting — the
operator only needs to ``hal0 model pull <id>`` and start the slot.

Picks intentionally use models from :mod:`hal0.registry.curated` so the
slot validates against the registry as soon as the model is downloaded.
We do NOT invent model names.

Backend choice respects ``hal0.config.schema._VALID_BACKENDS`` —
``vulkan``, ``rocm``, ``flm``, ``moonshine``, ``kokoro``, ``cpu``. (CUDA
is not a separate backend in v1; NVIDIA cards run via the Vulkan
backend, which llama.cpp's vulkan build supports on NVIDIA drivers too.)
