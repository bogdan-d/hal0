"""Slot lifecycle endpoints (mounted under /api/slots).

Phase 1: real SlotManager-backed lifecycle wired alongside synthetic
upstream-backed entries. Real slots win on name collision; synthetic
entries persist for remote-upstream visibility in the dashboard until
every upstream has a corresponding local slot.

SSE endpoints (note: there is no ``/api/slots/{name}/events`` — the
stream is split by concern):

- ``GET /api/slots/{name}/state/stream`` — state-machine transitions
  for one slot (``starting → warming → ready → serving → idle …``).
- ``GET /api/slots/{name}/logs/stream`` — line-by-line journal tail
  for the slot's systemd unit.

PR-11 (plan §11 + ADR-0008 §5): list responses are enriched with
config-derived fields (drawer seeds, declared backend) plus live
container state (``container_status`` / ``container_health``), and a
``coresident_group`` ID grouping slots that back the same FLM process
(the NPU trio: ``agent`` + ``stt-npu`` + ``embed-npu``). This is
backward-compatible — every legacy field is preserved; new keys are
purely additive.
