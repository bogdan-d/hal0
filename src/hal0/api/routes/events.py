"""Dashboard footer event surface — backfill + live SSE stream.

Mounted under ``/api/events`` by ``hal0.api.create_app``. Reads only; no
auth dependency because the footer must surface state during first-run
before any credential exists. Writers live on ``app.state.events`` and
are emitted from the slot state machine, pull jobs, and lifecycle hooks.

Endpoint contract::

    GET /api/events?since=<id>&type=<glob>&severity=<info|warn|error>&limit=<n=200>
        → {"events": [...], "next_since": int}

    GET /api/events/stream?since=<id>
        → SSE: backfill (id > since) then live tail; one ``data: <json>\\n\\n``
          frame per event. JSON carries its own ``type`` field so we don't
          emit a separate SSE ``event:`` name.
