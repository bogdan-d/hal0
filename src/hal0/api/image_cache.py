"""On-disk PNG cache for ``/v1/images/generations`` URL responses.

When the OpenAI body asks for ``response_format: "url"``, the
``/v1/images/generations`` route saves the generated PNG under
``/var/lib/hal0/images/cache/<uuid>.png`` and hands the client back a
hal0-hosted URL like ``/api/images/cache/<uuid>.png``. This module owns
the read/write/eviction surface for that cache.

LRU eviction policy:
    * Keep at most ``MAX_ENTRIES`` files (default 100).
    * Keep at most ``MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`` total (default 1 GB).
    * Whichever ceiling is hit first triggers eviction. Eviction
      removes the oldest files (by ``st_mtime``) until both ceilings
      are satisfied with margin.
    * Evictions run synchronously inside ``write_png`` — image gen is
      already a high-latency operation; an extra few ms of cleanup
      doesn't matter.

# NOTE: The cache directory is intentionally NOT cleared at install or
# uninstall time. Operators may want to retrieve recently-generated
# images after a hal0 update; the cache is small enough that "1 GB
# of disk forever" is a reasonable default. ``hal0 cache clear``
# (Phase 2) will give them a manual purge path.
