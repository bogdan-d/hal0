"""Bearer-token + Caddy-edge authentication dependency.

This module exposes two FastAPI dependencies:

  - :func:`require_token` — gates a single route or router.
  - :func:`require_token_unless_public` — gates a router globally but
    bypasses the auth check for paths in :data:`PUBLIC_PATHS`. This is
    what we attach at ``include_router(...)`` time on routers that mix
    public and protected endpoints (``/v1`` and ``/api/install``).

Public route allowlist
----------------------

The following stay public under ``HAL0_AUTH_ENABLED=1``:

  - ``GET  /api/health/system``        — liveness probe
  - ``GET  /api/status``               — dashboard liveness ping
  - ``GET  /api/metrics``              — prometheus / dashboard scrape
  - ``GET  /api/features``             — feature-flag inspection
  - ``GET  /api/install/state``        — first-run gating
  - ``POST /api/install/complete``     — first-run sentinel write
  - ``GET  /api/config/urls``          — host-aware URL hints
  - ``GET  /api/auth/status``          — auth-mode discovery
  - ``GET  /api/auth/login``           — placeholder (Caddy owns real login)
  - ``POST /api/auth/logout``          — clears local session hints
  - ``GET  /v1/models``                — OpenAI clients probe before auth

Everything else under ``/v1/*`` and the admin ``/api/*`` routes is
gated. Protected single-purpose routers (slots, models, providers,
hardware, logs, settings, updater) get the dep at router-include time;
mixed routers (``/v1``, ``/api/install``) get the path-aware variant
that consults :data:`PUBLIC_PATHS`.

Auth precedence
---------------

1. ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` present → validate against the token
   store. Failure ⇒ 401 (``auth.invalid``). Success ⇒ identity = token's
   label, scope = token's scope.

2. ``X-Forwarded-Email`` present (Caddy verified basic_auth at the edge,
   then forwarded the identity) → trust it. Scope = ``"admin"`` because
   Caddy's basic_auth users are the dashboard owners.

3. Else → 401 (``auth.required``).

When ``HAL0_AUTH_ENABLED`` is unset / falsy, ``require_token`` is a
no-op pass-through that returns the literal identity ``"anonymous"`` —
preserving full backward compatibility with the pre-auth installs that
449 of the existing tests exercise.

Notes on the identity contract
------------------------------

The dependency returns an :class:`AuthIdentity` dataclass so callers that
*do* want to branch on scope (the admin-only token CRUD routes) can do
``Depends(require_admin)`` cleanly without re-parsing the auth headers.
Most routes can ignore the return value — the side effect of refusing
the request when auth fails is the whole point.
