"""Atomic environment file writer.

write_env_atomic() is the only correct way to write slot .env files and
the openwebui.env file in hal0.  It uses a tmpfile in the same directory
as the target, then os.replace() for an atomic POSIX rename.  If the
process dies mid-write, the prior file is left intact.

This is the Tier 1 fix for the non-atomic env write bug identified in
haloai lib/slots.py:551-622.  See PLAN.md §5 Tier 1.

Usage::

    from hal0.config.env import write_env_atomic

    write_env_atomic(
        hal0.config.paths.slot_data_dir("primary") / "slot.env",
        {"HAL0_MODEL_PATH": "/var/lib/hal0/models/...", "HAL0_PORT": "8081"},
    )

    Writes the key=value pairs in env_dict to a temporary file in the same
